<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello!</h1>
<h2 align="left"> About Me</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
I am a soon-to-be Electronics Engineering graduate with a strong focus on Software Engineering. Over the past 4 years, 
I have dedicated myself to developing and maintaining cloud-native solutions for high-impact projects within the field 
of High-Performance Computing (HPC). 
  
With a deep interest in technology and its challenges, I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow. My background 
in electronic engineering has provided a solid mathematical foundation, which I have complemented with expertise in digital 
systems, microcontroller operation, design, and programming. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am particularly enthusiastic 
about exploring the MLOps field and engaging in self-learning to stay up-to-date with it.

I am ready to embark on a fulfilling career in Software Engineering, leveraging my technical skills and passion for technology 
to contribute to cutting-edge projects and make a positive impact on the world through innovation and creative problem-solving. 

Let's work together for a better future, harnessing the power of software as our tool!
